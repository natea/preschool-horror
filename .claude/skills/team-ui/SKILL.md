When this skill is invoked, orchestrate the UI team through a structured pipeline.

**Decision Points:** At each phase transition, use `AskUserQuestion` to present
the user with the subagent's proposals as selectable options. Write the agent's
full analysis in conversation, then capture the decision with concise labels.
The user must approve before moving to the next phase.

## Team Composition
- **ux-designer** — User flows, wireframes, accessibility, input handling
- **ui-programmer** — UI framework, screens, widgets, data binding, implementation
- **art-director** — Visual style, layout polish, consistency with art bible
- **engine UI specialist** — Validates UI implementation patterns against engine-specific best practices (read from `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` Engine Specialists → UI Specialist)
- **accessibility-specialist** — Audits accessibility compliance at Phase 4

**Templates used by this pipeline:**
- `ux-spec.md` — Standard screen/flow UX specification
- `hud-design.md` — HUD-specific UX specification
- `interaction-pattern-library.md` — Reusable interaction patterns
- `accessibility-requirements.md` — Committed accessibility tier and requirements

## How to Delegate

Use the Task tool to spawn each team member as a subagent:
- `subagent_type: ux-designer` — User flows, wireframes, accessibility, input handling
- `subagent_type: ui-programmer` — UI framework, screens, widgets, data binding
- `subagent_type: art-director` — Visual style, layout polish, art bible consistency
- `subagent_type: [UI engine specialist]` — Engine-specific UI pattern validation (e.g., unity-ui-specialist, ue-umg-specialist, godot-specialist)
- `subagent_type: accessibility-specialist` — Accessibility compliance audit

Always provide full context in each agent's prompt (feature requirements, existing UI patterns, platform targets). Launch independent agents in parallel where the pipeline allows it (e.g., Phase 4 review agents can run simultaneously).

## Pipeline

### Phase 1a: Context Gathering

Before designing anything, read and synthesize:
- `design/gdd/game-concept.md` — platform targets and intended audience
- `design/player-journey.md` — player's state and context when they reach this screen
- All GDD UI Requirements sections relevant to this feature
- `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` — existing patterns to reuse (not reinvent)
- `design/accessibility-requirements.md` — committed accessibility tier (e.g., Basic, Enhanced, Full)

Summarize the context in a brief for the ux-designer: what the player is doing, what they need, what constraints apply, and which existing patterns are relevant.

### Phase 1b: UX Spec Authoring

Invoke `/ux-design [feature name]` skill OR delegate directly to ux-designer to produce `design/ux/[feature-name].md` following the `ux-spec.md` template.

If designing the HUD, use the `hud-design.md` template instead of `ux-spec.md`.

> **Notes on special cases:**
> - For HUD design specifically, invoke `/ux-design` with `argument: hud` (e.g., `/ux-design hud`).
> - For the interaction pattern library, run `/ux-design patterns` once at project start and update it whenever new patterns are introduced during later phases.

Output: `design/ux/[feature-name].md` with all required spec sections filled.

### Phase 1c: UX Review

After the spec is complete, invoke `/ux-review design/ux/[feature-name].md`.

**Gate**: Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the verdict is APPROVED. If the verdict is NEEDS REVISION, the ux-designer must address the flagged issues and re-run the review. The user may explicitly accept a NEEDS REVISION risk and proceed, but this must be a conscious decision — present the specific concerns via `AskUserQuestion` before asking whether to proceed.

### Phase 2: Visual Design

Delegate to **art-director**:
- Review the full UX spec (flows, wireframes, interaction patterns, accessibility notes) — not just the wireframe images
- Apply visual treatment from the art bible: colors, typography, spacing, animation style
- Check that visual design preserves accessibility compliance: verify color contrast ratios, and confirm color is never the only indicator of state (shape, text, or icon must reinforce it)
- Specify all asset requirements needed from the art pipeline: icons at specified sizes, background textures, fonts, decorative elements — with precise dimensions and format requirements
- Ensure consistency with existing implemented UI screens
- Output: visual design spec with style notes and asset manifest

### Phase 3: Implementation

Before implementation begins, spawn the **engine UI specialist** (from `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` Engine Specialists → UI Specialist) to review the UX spec and visual design spec for engine-specific implementation guidance:
- Which engine UI framework should be used for this screen? (e.g., UI Toolkit vs UGUI in Unity, Control nodes vs CanvasLayer in Godot, UMG vs CommonUI in Unreal)
- Any engine-specific gotchas for the proposed layout or interaction patterns?
- Recommended widget/node structure for the engine?
- Output: engine UI implementation notes to hand off to ui-programmer before they begin

If no engine is configured, skip this step.

Delegate to **ui-programmer**:
- Implement the UI following the UX spec and visual design spec
- **Use patterns from `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md`** — do not reinvent patterns that are already specified. If a pattern almost fits but needs modification, note the deviation and flag it for ux-designer review.
- **UI NEVER owns or modifies game state** — display only; emit events for all player actions
- All text through the localization system — no hardcoded player-facing strings
- Support both input methods (keyboard/mouse AND gamepad)
- Implement accessibility features per the committed tier in `design/accessibility-requirements.md`
- Wire up data binding to game state
- **If any new interaction pattern is created during implementation** (i.e., something not already in the pattern library), add it to `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` before marking implementation complete
- Output: implemented UI feature

### Phase 4: Review (parallel)

Delegate in parallel:
- **ux-designer**: Verify implementation matches wireframes and interaction spec. Test keyboard-only and gamepad-only navigation. Check accessibility features function correctly.
- **art-director**: Verify visual consistency with art bible. Check at minimum and maximum supported resolutions.
- **accessibility-specialist**: Verify compliance against the committed accessibility tier documented in `design/accessibility-requirements.md`. Flag any violations as blockers.

All three review streams must report before proceeding to Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Polish

- Address all review feedback
- Verify animations are skippable and respect the player's motion reduction preferences
- Confirm UI sounds trigger through the audio event system (no direct audio calls)
- Test at all supported resolutions and aspect ratios
- **Verify `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` is up to date** — if any new patterns were introduced during this feature's implementation, confirm they have been added to the library
- **Confirm all HUD elements respect the visual budget** defined in `design/ux/hud.md` (element count, screen region allocations, maximum opacity values)

## Quick Reference — When to Use Which Skill

- `/ux-design` — Author a new UX spec for a screen, flow, or HUD from scratch
- `/ux-review` — Validate a completed UX spec before implementation
- `/team-ui [feature]` — Full pipeline from concept through polish (calls `/ux-design` and `/ux-review` internally)
- `/quick-design` — Small UI changes that don't need a full new UX spec

## Output

A summary report covering: UX spec status, UX review verdict, visual design status, implementation status, accessibility compliance, input method support, interaction pattern library update status, and any outstanding issues.
